# ticket-sales

A proof of concept node.js server I put together to handle locking and claiming of seats at an event.

## Installation

Make sure you have node.js on your system of at least version 0.6.  If you're on a Mac 
and have Homebrew installed, just type `brew install node`.

Next, clone this project:

    git clone git@github.com:dmuth/ticket-sales.git

Install the NPM modules:

    npm install
    
Run the unit tests (if you like):

    npm test
    
Play around with the test script (if you like):

    ./test.sh
    
To start the server:

    node ./main.js
